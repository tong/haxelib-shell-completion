## Haxelibs 'local' command is used to install a lokal haxelib.zip package (without submitting to the central repository)
## As haxelib only accepts .zip files it will only suggest completion for such in the current filpath
$ haxelib lo⇥⇥
$ haxelib local⇥ 
$ haxelib local mylib.zip (Assuming mylib.zip is the only zip file in wd)

And so on ..
